Widefires Analysis in Australia
Overview
This project focuses on analyzing widefires in Australia. It aims to understand the trends, patterns, and factors contributing to widefires occurrence, severity, and impact in different regions of Australia.

Data
The analysis utilizes a dataset containing information about widefires in Australia. This dataset includes the following columns:

Region: The geographical region where the widefire occurred.
Date: The date when the widefire was detected.
Estimated_fire_area: The estimated area covered by the widefire.
Mean_estimated_fire_brightness: The mean estimated brightness of the widefire.
Mean_estimated_fire_radiative_power: The mean estimated radiative power of the widefire.
Mean_confidence: The mean confidence level of widefire detection.
Std_confidence: The standard deviation of confidence levels.
Var_confidence: The variance of confidence levels.
Count: The count of widefires.
Replaced: Whether the data point was replaced or not.
The data is collected from reputable sources such as [insert data sources here].

Analysis
The analysis involves several steps:

Data Cleaning and Preparation: Pre-processing the dataset, handling missing values, and ensuring data quality.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Exploring the dataset to understand the distribution of widefires over time, geographical regions, and other relevant factors. This includes visualizations and statistical summaries.
Trend Analysis: Identifying trends and patterns in widefires occurrence, size, severity, and impact over different time periods and regions.
Factors Analysis: Investigating the factors contributing to widefires, including environmental conditions, land use, human activities, and climate change effects.
Tools and Technologies Used
