# Widefires Analysis in Australia

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing widefires in Australia to understand trends, patterns, and factors contributing to widefire occurrence, severity, and impact in different regions.

## Data

The dataset contains the following columns:

- **Region**: Geographical region of the widefire.
- **Date**: Date when the widefire was detected.
- **Estimated_fire_area**: Estimated area covered by the widefire.
- **Mean_estimated_fire_brightness**: Mean estimated brightness of the widefire.
- **Mean_estimated_fire_radiative_power**: Mean estimated radiative power of the widefire.
- **Mean_confidence**: Mean confidence level of widefire detection.
- **Std_confidence**: Standard deviation of confidence levels.
- **Var_confidence**: Variance of confidence levels.
- **Count**: Count of widefires.
- **Replaced**: Indicates if the data point was replaced.

## Analysis

1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Pre-processing the dataset, handling missing values, and ensuring data quality.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Exploring the dataset to understand the distribution of widefires over time, geographical regions, and other relevant factors.

3. **Trend Analysis**: Identifying trends and patterns in widefires occurrence, size, severity, and impact over different time periods and regions.

4. **Factors Analysis**: Investigating factors contributing to widefires, including environmental conditions, land use, human activities, and climate change effects.

## Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
